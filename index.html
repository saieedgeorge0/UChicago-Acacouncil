									<h2 class="major">Chicago Aag</h2>
									<p>Founded in 2014, Chicago Aag is UChicago's co-ed South Asian fusion a cappella group. Aag's repertoire is a marriage of Eastern and Western music traditions and features mash ups of English songs with popular music from the South-Asian region. They perform both on and off campus throughout the year; highlights include their performances at SASA's Diwali event (fall), the SASA show (spring), and the year-end concert (spring).</p>

									<h2 class="major">Make a Joyful Noise</h2>
									<p>Make a Joyful Noise (MaJN) is co-ed a cappella music ministry group at the University of Chicago dedicated to spreading God’s message of joy through music. Our group started back in 1993, and we’re still going strong. We sing all different types of music from contemporary Christian, to gospel, to pop hits. We are especially fond of our annual Christmas concert, bursting with both traditional and modern songs and lots of holiday spirit. We welcome people of all faiths and beliefs.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Men in Drag</h2>
									<p>Men in Drag brings spunk, grit, and heart to a cappella -- without any men. The group is dedicated to challenging gender conventions with an extensive rep of bold and empowering music from all genres, covering everyone from Young the Giant, BØRNS, and Hozier to Janelle Monáe, Gin Wigmore, and Lana del Rey. MID's covers have been featured on various national compilation albums, and their most recent solo album, Medusa Complex, was met with critical acclaim. Despite winning four CARA awards and a RARB track of the year, Men in Drag isn't one to rest on its laurels -- they recently released a cover of Coldplay and Beyoncé's Hymn for the Weekend, available now on iTunes and Spotify.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Rhythm n' Jews</h2>
									<p>RnJ is UChicago's premiere (and only) Jewish a cappella group. We are a healthy mixture of Jews and non-Jews and guys and girls, but we all love to have fun singing together! We perform pop music, Disney classics, Hebrew songs, and anything else we like the sound of. Our repertoire includes 24 Karat Magic, Be Prepared, Zodiac (a 1990's Israeli submission to Eurovision), and original compositions by our members. We perform at events around Chicagoland, participate in the ICCA a cappella competition, and organize singing tours in cities around the country. Our goal is to make our performances fun for everyone, so come check us out around campus!</p>

									<p>Founded in 2007 by a group of 5 students, RfC has grown to become one of the prominent all-male groups in the Midwest.

In the past two years, Run for Cover has released its debut album and two singles (one of which won RARB's single of the year!), which you can find on iTunes and Spotify. This year, the group is currently in the process of recording and releasing its second album. We always welcome new gigs and would love to sing for you - visit our website in order to get in touch!</p>
